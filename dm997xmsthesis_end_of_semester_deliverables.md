## DELIVERABLES FOR IDM ARCHIVES 

*Direct message the dropbox URL to deangela on slack.*

You really need to create a dropbox account if you have not already done so. Let me know if you do not have a dropbox account. Both you and I can get additional space if I invite you.

Each student will provide their own **dropbox link**. A dropbox link is actually different than sharing an actual *dropbox folder*. Here’s a how to: https://www.dropbox.com/help/167 (There is also a video explaining how to do it later in the page as well.) 
 
Create a dropbox link that contains the following: 
* PDFs
 * Final Thesis Paper
 * Final Thesis Defense Presentation
 * Letter to Next Cohort (see description below)
 * Resume and Cover Letter
 * URLs to the following all on one page 
   * thesis process website
   * portfolio website
   * linkedin profile
   * any other social media presences where you promote your work (instagram, twitter, facebook group or page, etc.) 
* Photo documentation
  * ***at least*** 3, hi-res images of your project (RAW preferably or 300dpi)
* Video or Audio documentation
 *  If creating a website or digital application (mobile, game, etc.), create video documentation by screen capturing a user interacting with your interface.
 *  If creating a physical object, musical instrument, or interactive installation, create video documentation of a user interacting with your object.
 *  If creating a video web series via youtube, vimeo, or other online channels, provide compressed video files of all videos.
 *  If creating an audio podcast, provide mp3s of all podcasts.
 *  

## PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

NOTE: This is different than your <a href="dm4003_thesis_website.md">Thesis Process Website</a>.

This website should market and promote your body of work for possible employment or other post graduation opportunities. This site should NOT be hosted on http://sites.bxmc.poly.edu. Ideally, you should have your own domain name.


## LETTER TO NEXT COHORT  

Write a letter to the next class giving them advice on how to succeed with their thesis paper, project, and defense. (What would you do differently if you could start the course again? What would you do the same?)
