# Thesis Roles

Your thesis is under the guidance of faculty and a community of peers, both inside and outside the university, who play a number of roles:

###Thesis Faculty (De Angela L. Duff, this semester)

* The Thesis Faculty is the primary critic and mentor throughout the thesis process. 

###Thesis Project Advisor

* The Thesis Project Advisor will meet with their Thesis Project Advisee at least 2 times (or more depending on their preference) throughout the semester to give feedback on the thesis paper, project, and/or defense presentation. 

* The thesis student will document the meetings (date, time, length, and typed notes) on their process website. 

* The Thesis Project Advisor will be the primary recommender for the external reviewer.

* The Thesis Project Advisor agrees to attend the Thesis Defense Panel, and will be given a digital copy of their Thesis paper for review. 

* The Thesis Defense will be scheduled at a time that is good for the Thesis Project Advisor and the External Reviewer sometime during Mon 12/7 through Fri 12/11. Date, Time, and Room to be determined.
External Reviewer (TBD in consultation with thesis project advisor)

###The External Reviewer (is identified in consultation with the Thesis Project Advisor.)

* The Thesis Project Advisor, Thesis Faculty or IDM's Coordinator of Academic Programs will contact the External Reviewer to determine their availability for the Thesis Defense. 

* The External Reviewer will attend the student's Thesis Defense Panel, and will be given a digital copy of their Thesis paper for review before the Defense.

###Your Thesis Accountability Partner

* You will partner with a classmate for moral support, ideation, proofreading, presentation practice, and most importantly to stay on task.

###Thesis Peers

* Your fellow graduate students are considered to be peers in the discussion and dialogue of your thesis. Students are strongly encouraged to share research and resources as well as critique from their peers. Utilize IDM's grad studio MAGNET 804 to hold informal critiques and discussion outside of class.
